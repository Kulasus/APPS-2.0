## Current TODOs:
- [X] Logging
- [X] LEDs
- [X] LEDs with PWM
- [X] Test PwmLed class
- [ ] Snake 

## LEDs:
Implementation of programs for leds on K64F-KIT. First part of course. Individual programs are in APPS-2.0/LEDs/PWM-BINARY/
### Serial line output: 
$ minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0
### binaryDisplay.cpp
Program which displays binary value which is selected with buttons
### ledsPWM.cpp
Program implements PwmLed class. This class represents pulse wide modulation on led to create illusion of brightness.
There are also three simulations:
- policie
    - Function which simulates police beacon.
- colourPicker
    - Function which lets you select led with button and increase/decrease its brightness with buttons.
- singal
    - Function which calculates and sets brightness of top red leds based on brighntess of rgb led.
### snake.cpp
Program also implements PwmLed class. This program implements function which represent snake, which goes throught leds.
You can stop him, increase or decrease his speed.
